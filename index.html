      <h2>Remembering Hunter S. Thompson</h2>
      <p>Forty-six years on, few people remember (or even care) that the 1970 Kentucky Derby was won by a horse called Dust Commander. And yet, the legacy of that particular race continues to loom large — not because of what happened at Churchill Downs,
        but because Hunter S. Thompson was there to write about it. "The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved," Thompson's account of the race for Scanlan's Monthly, is the subject of Gonzo @ the Derby, a highly entertaining new entry in ESPN's 30
        For 30 Shorts series.

        <p>Dear Jann, God damn, I wish you were here to enjoy this beautiful weather with me. It is autumn, as you know, and things are beginning to die. It is so wonderful to be out in the crisp fall air, with the leaves turning gold and the grass turning
          brown, and the warmth going out of the sunlight and big hot fires in the fireplace while Buddy rakes the lawn. We see a lot of bombs on TV because we watch it a lot more, now that the days get shorter and shorter, and darkness comes so soon,
          and all the flowers die from freezing.</p>

          <h2>Hunter S. Thompson, The Art of Journalism No. 1</h2>
          <p>In an October 1957 letter to a friend who had recommended he read Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead, Hunter S. Thompson wrote, “Although I don't feel that it's at all necessary to tell you how I feel about the principle of individuality, I know that
            I'm going to have to spend the rest of my life expressing it one way or another, and I think that I'll accomplish more by expressing it on the keys of a typewriter than by letting it express itself in sudden outbursts of frustrated violence.
            . . .”<br> Thompson carved out his niche early. He was born in 1937, in Louisville, Kentucky, where his fiction and poetry earned him induction into the local Athenaeum Literary Association while he was still in high school. Thompson continued
            his literary pursuits in the United States Air Force, writing a weekly sports column for the base newspaper. After two years of service, Thompson endured a series of newspaper jobs—all of which ended badly—before he took to freelancing from
            Puerto Rico and South America for a variety of publications. The vocation quickly developed into a compulsion.</p>
